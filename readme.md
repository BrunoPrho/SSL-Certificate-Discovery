# SSL Certificate Discovery in the Wild

This note presents a method to discover SSL certificate used in TLS using network discovery. The solution stores them into CSV files.
The advantage of the solution is that it is free and opensource ðŸ˜Ž.

**The method leverages [Nmap](https://nmap.org/) and the scripting engine. The user can also refers to the `ssl_cert`script from the Nmap distribution**. 


## Usage

The solution requires to uses `Nmap` and the script `discovery-certificate-csv.nse`. I have released the script under **GNU GPLv2**.
Scripting in `Nmap` is discussed in this [page](https://nmap.org/book/nse.html). 

- **IP/Port Arguments**: Nmap standard arguments are used for port and domain ranges. 

	- Port range are expressed as `x-y`
	- Nmap supports *CIDR-style* or *IP-style* such as `10.2.3.1-254`
- **CSV Output**: Results are stored into the CSV files given as argument:`"csv_output.basepath='result.csv'"`

*Example:*

```
 nmap --script discovery-certificate-csv.nse  -p 443-9999 192.168.20.1-5 --script-args "csv_output.basepath='result.csv'"
```

The ouput is a CSV with a `,` as separator and with columns such as

1. `host.ip` 
2. `host.name` 
3. `host.targetname` [domain]
4. `port.service` [tcp]
5. `port.protocol` [https]
6. `port.number` 
7. `x509 Server's Certificate` in base64


## Example
```
MacBookdebruno:~ bruno$ nmap --script discovery-certificate-csv.nse  -p 443 142.250.66.1-254  --script-args "csv_output.basepath='result.csv'"

## Business Use Case

The tool can be used to collect on any DMZ all the exposed certificates. The PEM can then later be decapsulated for analysis and x509 field extraction.
